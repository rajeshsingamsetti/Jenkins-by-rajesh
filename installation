Install Jenkins on AWS EC2
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

Prerequisites
EC2 Instance
With Internet Access
Security Group with Port 8080 open for internet
Java v1.8.x sudo su -
Install Java
We will be using open java for our demo, Get the latest version from http://openjdk.java.net/install/
Note we need java 1.8 if we had java 1.7 we need to remove from machine to remove yum remove -y java-1.7.0* java -version yum install java-1.8* #yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel



1. Confirm Java Version and set the java home
```sh
java -version
find /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8* | head -n 3

lets set the home path
cd ~
vi .bash_profile



JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-<Java version which seen in the above output>
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
 # To set it permanently update your .bash_profile
vi ~/.bash_profile
The output should be something like this, ```sh [root@~]# java -version openjdk version "1.8.0_151" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
